These modules are here to help me during the development of the game,
primarily for creation of maps for the game.

They work to my preference on how I want them to work.
If you want to make a map or something to "mod" the game,
I'll create a small guide at some point that will compile
all the shortcuts and stuff. But for now, read the source and wing it.
