# Anniversary Quest #
## An Anniversary Gift, Written in LOVE <3 (Lua) ##

This is the second time I've given my long-time girlfriend (Cyan) a game of her very own
for our anniversary. The first time, it was written in Game Maker. And alas, the project file is long gone!

This time I thought it'd be fitting (and somewhat ironic) to write it in LOVE Lua, and open source it because...
You know, why not!?

This is by no means the most well written game, as I'm starting it less than 3 weeks before our anniversary
(August 24).

### Credits ###
This game was written by me! (Jack) With help from:
     * [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org), a Lua framework by Anders Rude
     * [Simple Tiled Implementation (STI)](https://github.com/karai17/Simple-Tiled-Implementation), A very helpful tool for integrating Tiled into LÖVE2D games
     * [Lick.lua](https://github.com/headchant/LICK), A teeny tiny live code editing library that helped me save a lot of time

(So far) All of the art assets have been made by me. (This might change though!!)
