# Cyan's Adventre to Save the Things 2 #
## An Anniversary Gift, Written in LOVE <3 (Lua) ##

This is the second time I've given my long-time girlfriend (Cyan) a game of her very own
for our anniversary. The first time, it was written in Game Maker. And alas, the project file is long gone!

This time I thought it'd be fitting (and somewhat ironic) to write it in LOVE Lua, and open source it because...
You know, why not!?

This is by no means the most well written game, as I'm starting it less than 3 weeks before our anniversary
(August 24, since 2009).
