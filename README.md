# Anniversary Quest #
## An Anniversary Gift, Written in LÖVE :two_hearts: (Lua) ##
This is the second time I've given my long-time girlfriend (Cyan) a game of her very own
for our anniversary. The first time, it was written in Game Maker. And alas, the project file is long gone!

I'm hoping to get this done by our 10th anniversary in 2017. Wish me luck!

### Playing it ###
You'll need to have LOVE2D installed to your computer
Once that's done, just drag in the 'game' folder and it will play!

I also have a few batch files that do these automatically (for me), including one that combines the files into a standalone executable on windows and linux. I'll start pushing zip's incrementally when the game is something decent.

### Helping out??? ###
I'm pretty confident I can do this on my own. If you'd like to help out, well, I suck really hard at sprite art and even worse at making music and sounds. Right now the code is so prototype-y that there's really no point in getting others to help me with it. Maybe in the future!
